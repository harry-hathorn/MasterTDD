Bowling game
Write a program to score a game of Ten-Pin Bowling.

Input: string (described below) representing a bowling game

Output: integer score

The scoring rules:

·      Each game, or "line" of bowling, includes ten turns, or "frames" for the bowler.

·      In each frame, the bowler gets up to two tries to knock down all ten pins.

·      If the first ball in a frame knocks down all ten pins, this is called a "strike". 
	The frame is over. The score for the frame is ten plus the total of the pins knocked down in the next two balls.

·      If the second ball in a frame knocks down all ten pins, this is called a "spare". 
	The frame is over. The score for the frame is ten plus the number of pins knocked down in the next ball.

·      If, after both balls, at least one of the ten pins standing the score for that frame is simply the total 
	number of pins knocked down in those two balls.

·      If you get a spare in the last (10th) frame you get one more bonus ball. If you get a strike in the 
	last (10th) frame you get two more bonus balls.

·      These bonus throws are taken as part of the same turn. If a bonus ball knocks down all the pins, 
	the process does not repeat. The bonus balls are only used to calculate the score of the final frame.

·      The game score is the total of all frame scores.

Examples

·      X indicates a strike

·      / indicates a spare

·      - indicates a miss

·      | indicates a frame boundary

·      The characters after the || indicate bonus balls

Example 1

X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X||XX -> Total score = 10 frames x 30 = 300

Example 2

9-|9-|9-|9-|9-|9-|9-|9-|9-|9-|| -> Total score = 10 frames x 9 = 90

Example 3

5/|5/|5/|5/|5/|5/|5/|5/|5/|5/||5 -> Total score = 10 frames x 15 = 150

Example 4

X|7/|9-|X|-8|8/|-6|X|X|X||81 -> Total score = 167
