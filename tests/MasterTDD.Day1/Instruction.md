TDD Rules:

You shall not write production code other than to pass a failing test
You shall not write more of the production code than necessary to pass that failing test.
You shall not write more of the test than to make it fail for the right reason.


Triangulation - Only implement the logic once you see the pattern repeating 3 times


Exercises:
#1 - Leap year
Write a function that returns true or false depending on whether its input integer is a leap year or not. 
A leap year is defined as one that is divisible by 4, but is not otherwise divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400. For example, 2001 is a typical common year and 1996 is a typical leap year, whereas 1900 is an atypical common year and 2000 is an atypical leap year.



#2 Nth - Fibonacci
Write some code to generate the Fibonacci number for the nth position ex:

int Fibonacci(int position)

First Fibonacci numbers in the sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
